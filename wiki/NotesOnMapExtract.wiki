#summary Notes about the behaviour and output of map_extract.

= General Description and Usage =

Map_extract is based on Rick's reveal.exe and makes extensive use of his memory research. It accesses the memory of a running (and hopefully paused) Dwarf Fortress game to extract the landscape data and export the tile types and other parts into a gzipped text file.

= Details =

It will output the map data in two fashions:
*lite*: Contains ONLY the type data and is formatted in a way that one can easily do ctrl+f to replace numbers with ascii symbols ([http://dwarvis.googlecode.com/files/ascii_map.txt example]) 
*full*: This is intended to be loaded by another application (i.e. 3d visualizer software). It contains for each tile the type, the designation flags and the occupancy flags.

Both files are formatted in such a way to represent the data exactly as seen in DF, i.e. top left tile in game will be top left in the map file.

* The first line contains the name of the map that was entered while running the program, the x-size, the y-size and the z-size; seperated by |s.
* Each z-level is one block, started by one line that only contains the index of the current z-level, enclosed in -s.
* Each y-line has one line in the block, containing the tiles, seperated by |s.
* Each tile is either represented by a "-1", meaning it is unallocated; or a triplet numbers, seperated by :s.
* The numbers mean, in sequence: "type:designation flags:occupancy flags".
* The type ids are straight numbers, the meaning of which is still being decyphered, with results available [http://www.dwarffortresswiki.net/index.php/User:Mithaldu/Tile_types_in_DF_memory here] and [http://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=ppHCNfNceTrmxbXWDzf9aXg&hl=en here].
* The dependancy flags and occupancy flags are largely unknown, but some data on them is available in the [http://www.dwarffortresswiki.net/index.php/User:Rick/Memory_research#Data_Block DFWiki].
